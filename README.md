# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes telecom customer data to identify churn patterns and predict potential attrition using Python and machine learning.

## 🔍 Objective
The goal is to uncover key factors influencing customer churn and build a predictive model that enables strategic decision-making and retention efforts.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI** for interactive visualizations

## 📈 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing values, standardized column formats, and encoded categorical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identified patterns in tenure, service usage, contract type, and payment methods.
   - Visualized churn trends across customer segments.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created meaningful features to improve model accuracy.

4. **Modeling**
   - Built a logistic regression model to predict churn.
   - Achieved over **85% accuracy** using training and test sets.

5. **Insights & Visualization**
   - Delivered key findings through an interactive dashboard in Power BI.
   - Highlighted high-risk segments and retention strategies.

## 📌 Key Findings
- Short tenure and month-to-month contracts strongly correlate with churn.
- Higher service usage and specific payment methods show retention potential.
- Interactive dashboard provides actionable insights for business teams.


## 🚀 Outcome
This analysis empowers telecom providers to proactively reduce churn through targeted interventions, saving costs and improving customer loyalty.
